# random-objects-react

## About

This react-app serves as the frontend for my "random-objects" project. The underlying "random-objects" project, accessible [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/random-objects). This react-app is a versatile tool that generates random objects based on a blueprint of key and value pairs. Each key-value pair acts as a guideline, with values being either static or dynamically chosen from a set of functions. These functions can be used independently to create unique, random items. If you're familiar with JavaScript, you have the flexibility to write custom map or compare functions, or even create entirely new functions to tailor the generation process to your specific needs. Additionally, the app allows you to bookmark your blueprints and functions for later use.
